Pebble Video Player
============

This is based on the pebble-faces example project.

Use the scripts in conversionScripts to convert a video:

`./convertVideo.sh videoname.mp4 fps`

This will make a directory pbl and populate it with suitable PNG files.
To change to b+w, move the `...GREY.sh` file to replace `doPebbleConvert.sh`.
